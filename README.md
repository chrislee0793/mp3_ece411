# mp3_ece411
Pipelined processor for ECE 411 at UIUC (mp3)

All code in this repository was created by myself and my fellow team members, Justin Durante and Gregory Han. In addition, many of our contributions stem from the course staff and direction given in the ECE 411 course , a part of the ECE curriculum at UIUC.

This repository is meant to be used as a reference and personal resource only.
